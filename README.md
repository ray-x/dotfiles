## Vim Plugins

I used following plugin a lots

* ``Plug`` :
   My Plugin management tool

* vim-clap

   best plugin for search. I used it to replace fzf, leaderF, leaderP, NerdTree, Ag/Ack/Rg, yank(ring), project management. undolist and many more

* coc.nvim
   I disabled vim-go and turn to coc-go. Replace defx with coc-explorer, use coc-spell for spell check
   coc-snippet replaced my ultisnips. Also, there are coc for yml, json, prettier, python, rust, PHP (any language vs code
   supported)......

* ALE, well, I am still using ALE and configure lots of lint tool with it.

* Programming support: YCM (only for C++ and python), vim-go(for go testing, highlight),CompleteParameter, emmet-vim, tagbar/vista, polygot, and some
    language specific plugins (e.g html, js/ts, swift), ctags/gutentags, vim-less, govim(some cool AST)

* Debug: vimspector

* Theme, look&feel: onedark, eleline, devicons, startify, powerline, indentLine(with nerdfont),

* Color: nvim-colorizer.lua (display hex and color in highlight), rainbow, log-highlight, limelight, interestingwords

* Git: fugitive, gv, coc-git

* Format: tabular, coc-prettier(or, sometimes prettier), auto-pair

* Menu and tab: quickui, wintab

* Tools: floatterm, coc-todolist

* Move and Edit: easymotion, multi-cursor, vim-anyfold (better folding), check this: [You donâ€™t need more than one cursor in vim](https://medium.com/@schtoeffel/you-don-t-need-more-than-one-cursor-in-vim-2c44117d51db)

## Shell

* OMZshell is good, iterm2 is popular, but I turned to zprezto(with powerlevel10) + kitty. It is cooool and faster.
